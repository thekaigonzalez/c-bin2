a simple binary converter written in c. inspired by a pre-test i took today.

        THANKS FOR the one question I got SHAMED for, apparently knowing binary is a
        very common developer skill. what better way to learn than implement a simple
        algorithm to test it myself. 

        note: supports `0b` and normal binary string conversinos 

    [how it works]

        i wont bore you with the entire 'how it works' super-rundown on the
        history of computers, ill just tell you how i learned about binary
        numbers.
        
        apparently binary numbers are in 'base 2', meaning that every binary
        number is literally an exponent added by 1... with a base of 2.

        so this is easily recreated using C's pow() function.

        int fn = _z * (pow (2, x));

        this program keeps count of how many numbers are in the binary, and
        keeps track of every number in a
